# Screenshots

!!! Disclaimer
    The following screenshots are taken from possibly unreleased versions of Neovim, to showcase what is possible with a few plugins and lines of configuration: they are not representative of an out of the box experience.

## GUI Screenshots

Graphical interfaces are not packaged with Neovim. GUIs are not limited by terminal capabilities and can choose to override the rendering of certain neovim elements (cursor, tabline, popup menu, etc). This section showcases only a handful of them, see Neovim's wiki for a list of many of the available GUIs.
