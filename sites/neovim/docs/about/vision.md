# Vision

Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from [Stevie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_%28text_editor%29)).
It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

## Goals

* Enable **new contributors**, remove barriers to entry.
* Unblock plugin authors.
* Develop first-class **Lua/LuaJIT** scripting alternative to VimL.
* Target all platforms supported by libuv.
* Leverage ongoing Vim development.
* Optimize **out of the box**, for new users but especially regular users.
* Deliver consistent cross-platform experience.
* In matters of taste/ambiguity, favor tradition/compatibility...
* ...but prefer usability if the benefits are extreme.

## Non-goals

* Turn Vim into an IDE
* Limit third-party applications (such as IDEs!) built with Neovim
* Deprecate VimL
* POSIX vi-compatibility
