# Lua resources

## Where to look for lua guidance ?

Lua support improves with every release. Neovim 0.5 can for instance load its configuration from an init.lua instead of the traditional init.vim. The lua ecosystem around neovim is thrilling and so we list here a few resources to help you get started:

* A [starting guide](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide) for lua and neovim
* This [forum post](https://neovim.discourse.group/t/the-300-line-init-lua-challenge/227) lists several <300 lines of code init.lua

and of course the exhaustive `:help lua`.
