What is Neovim?
---------------

Neovim is a fork of the venerable text-editor vim, focused on extensibility and
usability. It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many
clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built
for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more. See a list of differences
at [:help vim-differences](https://neovim.io/doc/user/vim_diff.html).

What's new
----------

The [last newsletter](https://neovim.io/news/2016/11/) has gathered some dust,

### The near future: Upcoming

For an overview of planned features, goals and ideas for Neovim head to the [road
map](https://neovim.io/roadmap/). Some noteworthy upcoming PRs are:

- Floating Windows for external UIs (**@bfredl**, [#6619](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6619))

- Built in LSP support (**@tjdevries**, [#6856](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6856)) (see http://langserver.org/ why that could be of interest to you)

***PSA***: If you build Neovim from the latest master, always check [Following HEAD](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Following-HEAD) for any changes.


Around Neovim
------------------

The wiki page of [related
projects](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects) has seen quite
some additions, check out the full changes [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects/_compare/7ce8559...e2c051fd85226ff6a67c67f9de55ad9039aa2948).


### API clients

API clients are at the heart of Neovim's architecture, and significantly improve developer experience. Write a plugin in
any language you want! Since the last newsletter, we've seen the addition of another [C++](https://github.com/DaikiMaekawa/neovim.cpp) client, one for [Elixir](https://github.com/dm1try/nvim), and a [Racket](https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/neovim.rkt) client. The [node client](https://github.com/neovim/node-client) got an overhaul and a new maintainer. Thanks **@billyvg** for taking over! While not totally new, a special shoutout goes to the [ruby client](https://github.com/alexgenco/neovim-ruby) for being very well-maintained. Thanks, **@alexgenco**!


If you happen to prefer a language not yet listed, a good starting point are the [docs](https://neovim.io/doc/user/msgpack_rpc.html#RPC), and be sure to come talk about it on the [gitter channel](gitter.im/neovim).

### GUIs

Too much activity has happened on the GUI front to list all new clients, so let's just have a look at some that stand out. VSCode  is using Neovim to properly [integrate ex-mode commands](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim), and Sublime Text 3 gained [full Neovim integration](https://github.com/lunixbochs/actualvim). The latter also makes use of another
cool Neovim-specific feature, the externalized popupmenu, and it only took them
[50 LOC](https://github.com/lunixbochs/ActualVim/issues/57#issuecomment-286452725). Last but not least, [eovim](https://github.com/jeanguyomarch/eovim/) is an [enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/) client for Neovim.

### The Architecture of Neovim.

Some students have studied the Architecture of Neovim and published an
"analytical essay" about their findings. Be sure to
[have a look](https://delftswa.gitbooks.io/desosa-2017/content/neovim/chapter.html)
if you are interested in the bigger picture.

### Vimcasts and Modern Vim

Drew Neil of [vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org) fame has started recording [casts about Neovim](http://vimcasts.org/categories/neovim/), and began work on a successor to his praised book [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition) called [Modern Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/modvim/modern-vim). Most of the book will be  suitable for Vim 8 and Neovim users, but about 1/3rd of the book will cover Neovim-specific functionality.

### Libuv

One of the founding stones of Neovim has been porting I/O to libuv. So you will be happy to hear that libuv has set out to [support more platforms](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/1287). Neovim, soon coming to a platform near you!

### Test suite

Neovim offers easy testing via the wonderfully simple Lua language. Why aren't others doing it, you ask? Turns out, [they do](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/415), or at least, the neomutt project is preparing for it. Very nice to see ideas from Neovim [taken up](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/414).
